# k8s

All files stored here are usable k8s components to run some services. You need to change the environment variables to your needs.

# Componentes breakdown

* All files with `local-` prefix use local PV (persistent volume)
* All files with `nfs-` prefix use nfs 
* Other files do not need PV

# Why local components?

They are used for learning and testing purposes.
